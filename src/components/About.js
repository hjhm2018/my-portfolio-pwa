            My name is Henry Herrera, and I am a geological engineer turned web
            developer. I have a masters in geology and a postgraduate diploma in
            reservoir engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got interested in web development due to my last engineering job
            as a software specialist. I was involved with giving tech support to
            the company’s software users, but also in the testing of new
            software updates and versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            That inspiration led me to create my own websites learning by
            watching tutorials, and then I decided to make it more formal and
            took many web development courses starting in 2017 and continuing to
            this day. By now, I have developed 7 websites and published an app
            on Google Play (not available anymore).
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, I finished a diploma program in Web and Mobile Applications
            Development at Cornerstone International Community College of
            Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I recently completed my post-degree program in Web and Mobile
            App Design and Development program at Langara College in Vancouver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web technologies, programming languages, libraries, frameworks,
            CMS and databases that I have used include: HTML5, CSS, Sass,
            JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, React, AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB,
            Unity, PHP & MySQL, WordPress, GatsbyJS, Contentful and Vue.js.
